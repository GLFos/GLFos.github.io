This dataset displays the GDP and life expectancy in years for six different countries over 15 years.
The purpose of this project is to explore any correlations between the these two variables.
This project is supplied by data through Codecademy.com

A brief methodology of the process:
Started by cleaning the data, removing any null values or duplicates.
Printed any unqiue values for the countries and years within the dataset.
Calculated the correlation coefficient for GDP and life expectancy, with a value of 0.342
While positive, its rather weak. Correlation doesn't always mean causation, so the data will have to be explored further. 
A number of visualizations were made including bar graphs, line charts, and scatterplots. These were used at the author's discretion depending on the types of data being displayed. 

Summary of results:
Overall, life expectancy has increased across these countries over time.
This also goes for GDP, however some had much more growth than others.
Zimbabwe had the highest increase in life expectancy, while China had the most growth in their GDP.
While there is a slight postive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, we cannot definitively say that it is the direct cause.
These can be a wide variety of factors such as technology, geopolitical climate, etc.
